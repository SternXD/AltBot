# Stern's AltBot
This is Nythepegesus' implementation of AltBot for the AltStore/Delta servers. This bot attempts to implement all the old bot's commands and introduce more features. 

## Features
 * **Coming Soon**

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.10 installed, and run the following in a virtual environment:
```command line
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then fill out `conf.json` with the required information from `example-conf.json`.

Finally to run your bot, run `python3 main.py`.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the bot in any way, feel free! I'll assemble some Github templates for pull requests and issues eventually.
